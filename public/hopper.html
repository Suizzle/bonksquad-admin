      <p id = "warning">Warning: This peer-to-peer monetized online multiplayer Battleship game really works but it's pretty buggy, especially with respect to displaying transaction hashes from the BSV library. (I figure that's the kind of thing a BSV expert can easily help me fix should Bitcoinships place in this Hackathon and prove itself worthy of dedicated development.) If you are not a RUN Hackathon judge, I highly recommmend waiting until I've had a professional audit or review of the code done. If transaction history is important to you, use Money Button wallet for now to prove that I've paid out your winnings and refunds as appropriate.  Games cost 1 MILLI, which equals 0.001 BSV (one thousandth of a BSV token). Winner takes 1.74 MILLI and if a player gets disconnected, both players get their MILLI back minus BSV network fees. If Bitcoinships is a top finalist, I'll commit to making the game work flawlessly! -Andy</p>
